Pluto is an on-device debugging framework for Android applications, which helps in the inspection of HTTP requests/responses, captures Crashes, and ANRs, and manipulates application data on the go.

It comes with a UI to monitor and share the information, as well as APIs to access and use that information in your application.

## üñá &nbsp;Integrate Pluto in your application



### Add Gradle Dependencies

Pluto is distributed through [***mavenCentral***](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.plutolib/pluto). To use it, you need to add the following Gradle dependency to your build.gradle file of your android app module.

> Note: add both the `pluto` and the `pluto-no-op` variant to isolate Pluto from release builds.
```groovy
dependencies {
  debugImplementation 'com.plutolib:pluto:2.0.1-beta'
  releaseImplementation 'com.plutolib:pluto-no-op:2.0.1-beta'
}
```


### Initialize Pluto

Now to start using Pluto, initialize Pluto SDK from you application class by passing context to it.
```kotlin
Pluto.Installer(this)
  .addPlugin(DemoPlugin("demo_id"))
  .install()
```


### Install plugins

Unlike [version 1.x.x](https://github.com/plutolib/pluto/wiki/Integrating-Pluto-1.x.x), Pluto now allows developers to add debuggers as plugins based on their need.

Here is the list of some plugins provided by us

- **[Network Plugin](https://github.com/plutolib/pluto/blob/plugin_documentation/plugins/network/INTEGRATION.md)**
- **[Exceptions & Crashes Plugin](https://github.com/plutolib/pluto/blob/plugin_documentation/plugins/exceptions/INTEGRATION.md)**
- **[Logger Plugin](https://github.com/plutolib/pluto/blob/plugin_documentation/plugins/logger/INTEGRATION.md)**
- **[Shared Preferences Plugin](https://github.com/plutolib/pluto/blob/plugin_documentation/plugins/shared-preferences/INTEGRATION.md)**

We will be adding more to the [list](https://search.maven.org/search?q=com.plutolib.plugins). So please stay tuned.<br>
Please refer to their respective README for integration steps.
<br><br>
> You can also help us expand the Pluto ecosystem now. <br>Pluto now allows to develop custom debuggers as plugin. Read [Develop Custom Plugins](https://github.com/plutolib/pluto/wiki/Develop-Custom-Pluto-Plugins-(Beta)).

<br>

üéâ &nbsp;You are all set!

Now re-build and run your app, you will receive a notification from Pluto, use it to access Pluto UI.
