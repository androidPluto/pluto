Pluto is a on-device debugging framework for Android applications, which helps in inspection of HTTP requests/responses, capture Crashes and ANRs and manipulating application data on-the-go.

It comes with a UI to monitor and share the information, as well as APIs to access and use that information in your application.

## Integrate Pluto in your application



### Add Gradle Dependencies

Pluto is distributed through [***mavenCentral***](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.plutolib/pluto). To use it, you need to add the following Gradle dependency to your build.gradle file of you android app module.


```groovy
dependencies {
  debugImplementation 'com.plutolib:pluto:2.0.0'
}
```


### Intialize Pluto

Now to start using Pluto, intialize Pluto SDK from you application class by passing context to it.
```kotlin
Pluto.Installer(this)
  .addPlugin(DemoPlugin("demo_id"))
  .install()
```


### Install plugins

Unlike [version 1.x.x](https://github.com/mocklets/pluto/wiki/Integrating-Pluto-1.x.x), Pluto now allows developers to add debuggers as plugin based on their need.

Here is the list of some plugin provided by us

- **[Network Plugin](https://github.com/plutolib/plugin-network)**
- **[Exceptions & Crashes Plugin](https://github.com/plutolib/plugin-exceptions)**
- **[Logger Plugin](https://github.com/plutolib/plugin-logger)**
- **[Shared Preferences Plugin](https://github.com/plutolib/plugin-shared-preferences)**

We will be adding more to the [list](https://search.maven.org/search?q=com.plutolib.plugins). So please stay tuned.

Please refer to their respective README for integration steps.



üéâ You are all set!

Now re-build and run your app, you will receive a notification from Pluto, use it to access Pluto UI.
