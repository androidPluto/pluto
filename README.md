Pluto is a on-device debugger for Android applications, which helps in inspection of HTTP requests/responses, capture Crashes and ANRs and manipulating application data on-the-go.

It comes with a UI to monitor and share the information, as well as APIs to access and use that information in your application.

> Note: add both the pluto and the pluto-no-op variant to isolate Pluto from release builds.
```groovy
dependencies {
  debugImplementation 'com.mocklets:pluto:1.2.0'
}
```


### Intialize Pluto

Now to start using Pluto, intialize Pluto SDK from you application class by passing context to it.
```kotlin
Pluto.Installer(this)
  .addPlugin(DemoPlugin("demo_id"))
  .install()
```




üéâ You are all done!

Now re-build and run your app, you will receive a notification from Pluto, use it to access Pluto UI.
